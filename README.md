# Java - Body Mass Index

We want to develop a program that calculates the body mass index of a person. To do this, you need to define the person's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). The body mass index (BMI) is calculated using the following formula:

BMI = weight / height2

Then, from the BMI obtained it is possible to calculate whether a person is normal, underweight, overweight or obese. To generate these results the calculated BMI must be in the ranges of the table (See attached document).

## Requirements:

- It is not necessary to generate an output per terminal.
- It is mandatory to perform the unit tests.
